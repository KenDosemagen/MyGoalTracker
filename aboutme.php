<div id="amgp">
    <p>My name Ken, I am 31 years old. I have a wife and two little girls ages five and two. Earlier this year (2021), I decided it was time for me to go back to school and pursue something that I have always been interested in, Web Development. The basics of web development are fairly simple to pick up on. But what I like about web development is, you’re always learning. You wont really ever master one programming language. </p>
    
    <p>With this is someone could track their personal goals, any professional goals they could have, or any other type of goal they would like. When deploying this site into the real world I would like to have an account system set up to properly track peoples’ goals into their own database not just a shared database. Once a goal would be completed, the users could log in, and simply click a “complete” button and that goal would move to their Completed section. In my head, the Completed section is like a scrapbook of events in your life you could always look back at and be proud of.</p>
