<h3 id="amg">Information About My Goal and How We Can Help You</h3>
<div id="amgp">
    <p>My Goal is a site you can use the create, review, and plan goals you would like to set for yourself or someone else. You have the option to create personal goals, professional and/or work-related goals, or any other type of goal you would like to set and track for you or someone you know.</p>
    <p>A man named Zig Ziglar had seven steps of goal setting that are still useful today. Identify the goal, list the benefits, list the obstacles to overcome, list the skills and knowledge required, list the people or groups to work with, create an action plan, and set a deadline to achieve your goal. He also said “You can choose to set goals and recognize your potential. Or you can choose not to set them, but you have to understand the consequences will not be good down the road.” Goal setting is a big part of anyone’s life. Without goals we would not achieve the great things we all want to do.</p>
    <p>You can use My Goal as a resource to identify and list your goals you would like to set. You can set a date you would like to complete your goal by. We list all active goals and complete goals you have set in an easy-to-read list. Once you complete a goal that is on your active list, make sure you come back and mark it off to add it to your completed goal list. Below are some videos to watch of Zig Ziglar to get you excited.
